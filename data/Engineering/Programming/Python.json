Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group, the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.\n2. Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, \"346\" is replaced with \"13\" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.\n3. Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k, repeat from step 1. Return s after all rounds have been completed.",
